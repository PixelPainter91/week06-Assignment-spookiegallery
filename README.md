For this week’s assignment, I built upon the “LilDeath” sprites, movement, and attack code from Week 3. I got a bit carried away focusing on the attack animation and the urn-breaking interaction.

I’m drawn to the pixel art style and keep returning to it, but for next week’s assignment, I plan to explore a more consumer- or professional-oriented design, as I want to develop skills that will help me in a professional context.

I’ve found React challenging. Initially, I really enjoyed using it, but on a larger project, some of my folder and CSS structure choices have caused confusion later on. Overall, I enjoy working with React, but I definitely need more practice to manage more complex projects efficiently.

For the gallery, I followed this tutorial: https://youtu.be/g8pcxzDl-w8?si=j4nEVS71eslJi1F0, but I didn’t implement motion. I also tried to make it responsive based on my Week 2 assignment, and while it works well on mobile, it still needs improvement on tablets.

I decided not to include a search bar as part of my design. I hope this design choice does not negatively affect my marks.
